### Information about the project

There is 1 main file in the project: main.py
There are 3 main classes in the project: Library, Book, and User
There is 1 test file in the project: testcases.py
There is 1 txt file with the given instructions: instructions.txt

<br>

The main file contains the code to run the project. It got a little messy.
I also got carried away and made the main file able to create multiple separate libraries.

<br>

The test file contains the code to test the project classes using unittest.
It does not test the main file.
